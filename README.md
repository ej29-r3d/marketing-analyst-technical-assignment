# Senior Marketing Analyst - Technical Assignment

## Overview
Welcome! This assignment simulates a real-world scenario where you need to unify and analyze multi-channel advertising data. While marketing analysts don't typically deploy databases in day-to-day work, we want to ensure you're technical enough to tackle any challenge that comes your way.

Your mission: Transform raw advertising data from three major platforms into actionable insights through a unified data model and compelling visualizations.

## Data Files
- `01_facebook_ads.csv` - Facebook advertising metrics
- `02_google_ads.csv` - Google Ads campaign data
- `03_tiktok_ads.csv` - TikTok advertising engagement

## Requirements

### 1. Database Setup
- Upload all three CSV files to a cloud database of your choice
- Create an additional table that unifies data from these 3 tables
- Any professional cloud database is acceptable (BigQuery, Redshift, Snowflake, PostgreSQL, etc.). Most of them should have a free tier and free tier is enough.

### 2. Dashboard
Create a one-page dashboard visualizing the integrated data. Include key metrics and insights you find relevant for cross-channel performance analysis.

## Deliverables

1. **Link to live dashboard** (required)
2. **SQL scripts** used for data transformation and unified model creation

## Submission
Send the dashboard link and GitHub repository with your SQL scripts and documentation.

## Evaluation
We'll assess technical execution, data accuracy, visualization quality, and insights generated.
