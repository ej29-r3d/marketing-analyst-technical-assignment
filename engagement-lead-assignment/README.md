# Engagement Lead - Technical Assignment

## Overview
Welcome! This assignment simulates a real-world scenario where you need to unify and analyze multi-channel advertising data.

While Engagement Leads don't typically build dashboards or deploy databases in day-to-day work, we want to ensure you're technical enough to understand our clients' data, speak confidently about data transformations, and tackle any challenge that comes your way.

## Data Files

- `01_facebook_ads.csv` - Facebook advertising metrics
- `02_google_ads.csv` - Google Ads campaign data
- `03_tiktok_ads.csv` - TikTok advertising engagement

## Requirements

### 1. Database Setup

- Upload all three CSV files to a cloud database of your choice
- Create an additional table that unifies data from these 3 tables
- Any professional cloud database is acceptable (BigQuery, Redshift, Snowflake, PostgreSQL, etc.). Most have free tiers sufficient for this task.

### 2. Dashboard

Create a one-page dashboard visualizing the integrated data. Include key metrics and insights relevant for cross-channel performance analysis.

### 3. Video Walkthrough (3-5 minutes)

Record a single video where you:

**Part A - Technical Walkthrough (~2 min)**
- Open the database tool where you performed your data transformation
- Show your SQL script and briefly explain your transformation logic
- Walk through how you unified the three data sources

**Part B - Dashboard Presentation (~2-3 min)**
- Present your dashboard as if you're showing it to a client
- Highlight 2-3 key insights from the data

## Deliverables

1. Link to live dashboard
2. SQL script used for data transformation
3. Video link (Loom, Google Drive, or any shareable format)
